                <h3>About Me</h3>
                
            </div>

            <p>I&rsquo;m never really used to answer question like tell me something about you. It always made me questioning myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>do I know me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let me try to go out of my comfort zone, and try to tell you about myself. LOL.</p>
<h3 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h3>
<p>So lets begin with this blog title. Hmm is there something about the title?. Yep, it is the word Î≥Ñ (byeol) which means star in english. And that word Î≥Ñ &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; same as my name in Bahasa Indonesia which is Bintang üòÅ.</p>
<p>My full name is Muhammad Bintang Bahy. I&rsquo;am very blessed with this name which my parents gave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the of person who can remember what event happened in specific date. But there is some specific historical event that I can remember clearly. It is sumpah pemuda. Why? You ask. Because &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; it has the same date as my birthday, which was at 28 October 1997.</p>
<p>I was born in Yogyakarta. Raised in Yogyakarta. And lived my whole life until now In Yogyakarta. It is not like I dont want to go to other places to study, etc. It is just the fate that made me stay here until now.</p>
<h3 id="my-interest">My interest</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently studying Computer Science in Universitas Gadjah Mada. And I love my major so much. Who know that some silicon can make a whole new world, and an endless possibilities to learn.</p>
<p>And of course in Computer Science you cant be far away from coding. I started my coding journey using Visual Basic when I was in middle school. At the time I was really interested in it, but gave up due to lack of information that I got at that time, because I dont have access to book or internet. This is one of my biggest regret that I dont try hard enough to learn. Maybe if I try hard enough back then, now I could have been some kind of programmer genius üòÇ. (ofc not)</p>
<p>A lot of time passed, and I got back to coding in Uni. The first programming language that I learn in Uni is C++. Which I think is really good for fundamentals compared to other programming language like Python. Maybe for beginners it has steep learning curve, but once got it jumping from one programming languange to the other is easier. Compare to if you learn Python then try to learn C++. Of course it is just my opinion, dont take it too seriously üòõ.</p>
<p>C++ got me in to Competitive Programming. Which is one of the biggest stepping stone for me. Although I&rsquo;m not that good compared to other in this field. It gives a lot of experience about Algorithm, Time Complexity, Space Complexity, etc which helps me a lot in other field.</p>
<p>Some times passed in Uni and I am starting to interested in Web Development. In which I learnt a lot about architecture, protocols,  html, css, api, and much more other terms. And while I&rsquo;m studying I got to learn a lot new language. Some of them I created and app for. I&rsquo;ve written some app using Node.JS, Python, PHP, and Golang. But I&rsquo;m most fluent javascript especially Node.JS.</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;m really interested In Cyber Security. I learn a lot about Cyber Attacks and how to defends againts it. And along the way I also got into learning some DevOps.</p>
